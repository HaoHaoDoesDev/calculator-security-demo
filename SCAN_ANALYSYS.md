## Recommendations
Based on the provided ZAP DAST scan report, 
the prioritization for remediation should strictly follow the Risk Level,

the immediate focus must be on addressing the 3 Medium risk alerts, 
as these represent the most significant potential security weaknesses found in the running application.
